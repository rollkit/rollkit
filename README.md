## Using Evolve

### Example Implementation: TestApp CLI

The easiest way to understand how to use Evolve is by exploring our example implementation, TestApp.

Requires Go version >= 1.22.

TestApp is a CLI tool that demonstrates how to run different kinds of nodes using the Evolve framework.
It serves as a reference implementation and helps you understand how to build your own Evolve-based blockchain.

#### Install

To install the example `testapp`, simply run the following command at the root of the
ev-node repo:

```bash
make install
```

The latest TestApp example is now installed. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
testapp version
```

#### Quick Start

You can spin up a local TestApp network (powered by Evolve) with the following command:

```bash
testapp start
```

## Building with Evolve

Evolve is the first sovereign application framework that allows you to launch
a sovereign, customizable blockchain as easily as a smart contract.
TestApp serves as a reference implementation to help you get started with your own Evolve-based blockchain.
